This download will install a set of components that facilitate the transfer of data between
 existing Microsoft Office files such as Microsoft Office Access 2010 (*.mdb and *.accdb) files
 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (*.xls, *.xlsx, and *.xlsb) files to other data sources such
 as Microsoft SQL Server. Connectivity to existing text files is also supported. ODBC and OLEDB 
drivers are installed for application developers to use in developing their applications with 
connectivity to Office file formats.

The Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable is not intended:

As a general replacement for Jet (If you need a general replacement for Jet you should use SQL
 Server Express Edition).
As a replacement for the Jet OLEDB Provider in server-side applications.
As a general word processing, spreadsheet or database management system -To be used as a way to
 create files. (You can use Microsoft Office or Office automation to create the files that Microsoft Office supports.)
To be used by a system service or server-side program where the code will run under a system 
account, or will deal with multiple users identities concurrently, or is highly reentrant
and expects stateless behavior. Examples would include a program that is run from task scheduler when 
no user is logged in, or a program called from server-side web application such as ASP.NET, or a distributed
component running under COM+ services.
